Main project was a 5/10 in difficulty (was pretty straightforward).
Debugging was a bit hard to do without prewritten test cases (too used to being spoonfed lol)

It took me about 11 hours to do the project, including at least 3 hours of debugging,
1 hour of testing, and 1 hour of nonrelated activities (breaks).

I did Extra Credit #1: Variable size sliding window
I implemented a variable size window that increases (by 1) everytime there is a
successful ack, and decreases (by 1)when there is a transmit timeout or 3 dupacks in a row.
The window is restricted to a minimum of 1 and max of 5 because of max window size being 5.
